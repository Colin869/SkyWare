## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Application Won't Start
- Ensure Python 3.7+ is installed
- Check that all dependencies are installed
- Verify the `main.py` file is in the correct directory

#### WIT Tool Not Found
- Install the WIT tool from the official repository
- Add WIT to your system PATH
- Or place `wit.exe` in the application directory

#### **NEW!** Logging Issues
- Check the `logs/` directory exists
- Verify write permissions for the application directory
- Check console output for error messages

#### **NEW!** Preferences Not Saving
- Ensure the application has write permissions
